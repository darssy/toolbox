# Toolbox

## About
A collection of classes methods and utilities that seem useful and quite common to me. The code is pretty simple and most of the times what you need to know is in documentation, which admittedly is not complete yet.

Currently this library is **NOT** stable. Most of the code comes from elements of [DARSSY](http://darssy.com) and thus this code is used in a real world application. Now where I come from we use to say "one equals none" but I say one is better than none. Anyway, once I decide which parts of the original code I will open source, I will release a stable 1.0 version, hopefully with some unit tests as well. Currently the test coverage is at an un-amazing 13%.
